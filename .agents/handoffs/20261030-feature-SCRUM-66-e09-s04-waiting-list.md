# feature/SCRUM-66-e09-s04-waiting-list

Goal: implement the backend and attendee UI for E09-S04 / SCRUM-66, covering Event-level waitlist join, live status and leave, place-release notifications, and first-come claim through the existing registration flow. Per the user's instruction, do not perform manual tester steps; keep human acceptance open.

## Scope and decisions

- Canonical story: `docs/backlog/release-1/E09-attendee-registration.md`; acceptance cases: `docs/testing/cases/E09.md`; team decision T-98 keeps lists at Event level and sends a full selected Session through the existing Pending path.
- T-46 and C-23 rule out queue positions, automatic promotion, and a reservation window. All waitlisted Attendees are notified when a registered place becomes available; the first completed claim wins.
- Reuse the registration event lock/capacity logic and E09-S05 withdrawal endpoint where possible. Account deactivation also withdraws upcoming waitlisted rows and must preserve place-release notices for remaining waitlisted Attendees.
- SCRUM-66 and SCRUM-222/223/224 are To Do and assigned to Aaron Koh. Do not change issue ownership. Leave SCRUM-224, the parent story, and human acceptance open.
- Existing `TC_E09S04_02` and `_05` mention list positions despite T-46. Resolve those wording conflicts against T-46/T-98 and regenerate the test-case workbook and coverage inventory if changed.

## Progress

- Started from current `origin/main` after opening PR #378 for SCRUM-50.
- SCRUM-66 dependencies E09-S01/S02 and E09-S05 are already implemented in merged registration code; this branch must be reviewed for overlap with their owners' work.
- Read the current story, subtasks, acceptance cases, DoD, instructor guidance, source-of-truth rules, notification implementation, and registration code. No implementation changes committed yet.

## Next steps

1. Inspect migrations, routes, tests, and database-test workflow; implement the smallest complete backend and frontend change.
2. Add unit/component and suitable automated integration coverage, with full changed-code coverage. Do not run database-writing suites against Supabase or start Docker Desktop.
3. Keep notes and verification evidence current; create T-65 records only for runs cited as evidence.
4. Run repository checks before commits, commit in small reviewable steps, and open a partial technical PR while leaving SCRUM-224 and SCRUM-66 open for human acceptance.
